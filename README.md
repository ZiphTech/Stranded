// Update 11/16/13
This is the last modification I have made to the project
and I have since discontinued development on it. One of the
major reasons being is my person inexperience at the time with
object oriented design. The code and structure looks like a mess
but it has been a great learning experience for me none the less!

If some other individual happens to stumble upon this mess and
continue the work I wish them the best of luck and to not judge
me too harshly on my first major attempt with OOD!

Good luck and farewell, till next time.



// First commit
This is a project I am currently designing for my
Java programming course. I am also new to using
github but so far I am enjoying it. Hopefully later
I will put something useful in here!
